## Python: A true multi-purpose language and its role in Data Science

Today, I will be talking about one of the popular programming languages [Python](https://www.python.org) and how it has evolved over the last couple of years to become a true multi-purpose programming language. We will also be looking at how Python enables us to become better data scientists using its vast arsenal of data analysis and machine learning tools, libraries and frameworks and how should we ideally go about exploring them.

### Why Python?

Before, we begin, one might be thinking, why should we choose Python over any other programming language? I would say that no language is suitable for solving all kinds of problem, however Python being a multi-purpose programming language can be used in different domains to build solutions for different scenarios. Some examples include,

 - Web and Internet Development
 - Web Crawling and Scraping
 - Network and System Programming
 - Automation and Testing Frameworks
 - Scientific and Numeric Computing
 - Data Analytics, Visualization
 - Machine Learning and AI
 - Game Programming
 - Desktop GUIs
 - Software development, Build management and Continuous Integration

Some interesting features of Python include,

 - Python is `dynamically typed`: it means that you don't declare a type (e.g. 'integer') for a variable name, and then assign something of that type (and only that type). Instead, you have variable names, and you bind them to entities whose type stays with the entity itself. `a = 5` makes the variable name `a` to refer to the integer `5`. Later, `a = "hello"` makes the variable name `a` to refer to a string containing `"hello"`.
 - Python is `both an interpreted and compiled language`. It falls under the category, byte code interpreted. The `.py` source code is first compiled to byte code as `.pyc`. This byte code can be interpreted (official `CPython`), or JIT compiled (`PyPy`). Python source code (`.py`) can be compiled to different byte code also like `IronPython` (`.Net`) or `Jython` (`JVM`).
 - Python is `strongly typed`. It means that if `a = "5"` (the string whose value is `'5'`) will remain a string, and never coerced to a number automatically if the context requires so. Every type conversion in python must be done explicitly. 
 - Python is `object oriented`, with class-based inheritance. Everything is an object (including classes, functions, modules, etc), in the sense that they can be passed around as arguments, have methods and attributes. You can also pass functions as arguments to other functions, wrap a function with another function ( decorators ) and so on.
 - Python is a `multipurpose language`: it is not specialised to a specific set of users (like R for statistics, or PHP for web programming). It is extended through modules and libraries, that hook very easily into the C programming language.
 - Python enforces correct indentation of the code by making the indentation part of the syntax itself! There are no control braces in Python. Blocks of code are identified by the level of indentation and this improves code readability.
 - Python `can be used for any programming task`, from GUI programming to web programming with everything else in between. It's quite efficient, as much of its activity is done at the C level. Python is just a layer on top of C. 
 - Python has `libraries for everything` you can think of: game programming and openGL, GUI interfaces, web frameworks, semantic web, scientific computing, machine learning, image processing and so on.
