Today, I will be talking about Business Intelligence and how to leverage Microsoft's Business Intelligence Stack to get valuable insights and extract the maximum information out of your enterprise data. Recently, one of my projects required me to do some analysis of data to improve existing processes in the organization. The best way to do so, was to get the data from the underlying databases, build a proper data semantic model and generate reports from that to view insights and comprehend them easily. In pursuit of solving this use case, I explored the Microsoft BI Stack and realised its excellent potential for tacking these scenarios. 

Before we begin, I will describe briefly what Business Intelligence (BI) indicates, since we will be talking about tools which enable us to do BI better.**Business intelligence (BI)** is the set of techniques and tools for the transformation of raw data into meaningful and useful information for business analysis purposes. BI can be used to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business decisions include priorities, goals and directions at the broadest level. BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies are reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. For more details you can check out [this Wikipedia page on BI](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Business_intelligence). 

The Microsoft BI Stack consists of several tools which are mostly indicated in the picture shown below.

With tools like SSAS, you can load in data from different sources be it MS SQL databases and warehouses, Oracle, Teradata, CSVs, Flat files and much more. Once you have this data in SSAS, you can build semantic models and perform various analytics on the data as required. Once the BI Semantic Model is built and deployed, you can use tools like SSRS, PowerView and so on to build dashboards and reports on top of this model and present insights in different ways which are both appealing and informative.

Coming to the BI Semantic Models, there are two types of Data models which are supported in Microsoft. They are explained below.
 - **Multi-dimensional models:** The multidimensional model uses cube structures for analyzing business data across multiple dimensions. Multidimensional mode is the default server mode of Analysis Services. It includes a query and calculation engine for OLAP data, with MOLAP, ROLAP, and HOLAP storage modes to balance performance with scalable data requirements. 
 - **Tabular models:** Tabular models are in-memory databases in Analysis Services. Using state-of-the-art compression algorithms and multi-threaded query processor, the xVelocity in-memory analytics engine (VertiPaq) delivers fast access to tabular model objects and data by reporting client applications such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power View. Tabular models support data access through two modes: Cached mode and DirectQuery mode. In cached mode, you can integrate data from multiple sources including relational databases, data feeds, and flat text files. In DirectQuery mode, you can bypass the in-memory model, allowing client applications to query data directly at the (SQL Server relational) source.

The Microsoft BI Semantic Model architecture is shown in the picture below.

Thus you can see that the Microsoft BI Stack is quite diverse and consists of a large toolkit. Sometimes the different tools can be confusing because of their sheer number and extremely long names! But don't let that discourage you because once you start using them, you will definitely love it if you are a data scientist\engineer\analysis or a BI developer. Thats all for now, hope you enjoy building business intelligence solutions with the Microsoft BI Stack. Credits for the information and images go to Microsoft.
